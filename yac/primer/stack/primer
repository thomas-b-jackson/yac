{COMMAND}

Available comands include:

  yac {COMMAND} (-h | primer)

Stack executes a service build in a given pipeline stage.

Say the 'platformengineering/redis:4.6' service has three stages in its pipeline:

* dev
* test
* prod

Say you want to deploy the 'platformengineering/redis:4.6' service in the dev stage.

Do a dry run build as:

$ yac stack platformengineering/redis:4.6 -d

If all goes well, build the service as:

$ yac stack platformengineering/redis:4.6
